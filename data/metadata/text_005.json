  "notes": "The text adapts traditional Arabic curriculum to present needs. Chinese instructions exhibit features of contemporary language usage, likely the work of Ma Xiqing. Arrangment of material still follows the structure of classical Arabic pedagogy historically popular among Sinophone Muslims. First edition was published in 1990, second edition in 1994. Current text is a reprint from the second edition. "
