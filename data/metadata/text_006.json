  "notes": "Little is known of the text's origin, its author, or its year of publication. The text is an exemplar of xiao'erjing or xiaojing, which refers to the practice of using Arabic script -- with a few additional letters invented to cover sounds in Chinese that have no correlates in Arabic -- to transliterate Chinese. The text preserves much of the oral nature of the instruction and is thus akin to lecture notes. "
