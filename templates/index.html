                            <p>Currently, large numbers of Muslims, in particular the Turkophone Uyghur Muslims, are
                                being
                                detained

                                “re-education” camps, forced labor, and sterilization. While not all Muslims face the
                                same

                                to audio files to short video clips, that document the living ritual practices of
                                China’s
                                Muslims,
                                with a focus on the Sinophone Hui Muslims. We strive to show how texts are performed and
                                embodied in
                                real life, and preserve visual and auditory evidence that may offer essential support
                                for
                                uncovering
                                transregional connections that remain invisible in texts. Using this online archive we
                                hope
                                to
                                illustrate the movement of languages, politics, religious recitations, and cultural
                                practices
                                within
                                and beyond the Sino-Muslim communities through the centuries.

                            <p>His latest book, <i>The Sound of Salvation: Voice, Gender, and the Sufi Mediascape in
                                China</i>,
                                is published by Columbia University Press. He is the co-editor of <i>The Contest of

                                    Fruits</i> (MIT 2021) and <i>Ethnographies of Islam in China</i> (Hawai'i 2020).
                                He
                                first
                                began
                                collecting Islamic manuscripts on an ad hoc basis when carrying out fieldwork among
                                China’s Sinophone Muslims. He soon realized that the translingual nature of the
                                texts
                                could provide new entry points into thus far under-examined, if not altogether
                                forgotten
                                histories – hence the beginning of this project.</p>
